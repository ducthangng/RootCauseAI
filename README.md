NHTSA Complaints (primary recommendation)

Bulk flat file (all complaints, ~354 MB, this is your 500k+ row source): https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/cmpl/FLAT_CMPL.zip
Field/schema layout for that flat file (you'll need this — it's pipe-delimited, no header row): https://www.nhtsa.gov/nhtsa-datasets-and-apis
REST API (good for incremental/live lookups, not for the bulk 500k dump): https://api.nhtsa.gov/complaints/complaintsByVehicle?make={MAKE}&model={MODEL}&modelYear={YEAR}
NHTSA Recalls flat file (post-2010, ~14MB — you'll want this too, since your product decides "recall or not"): https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/ffdd/rcl/FLAT_RCL_POST_2010.zip
Pre-cleaned Kaggle mirror if you want to skip the raw flat-file parsing pain (2019–present only, smaller): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alshival/nhtsa-complaints
